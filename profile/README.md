## We are Laminar-terminal.

Our aim is to provide a new terminal with custom addon support, themes, and a way to keep all your dotfiles synced and safe inside a GitHub repository!
And unlike other projects we are crosscompiling to linux and windows from the get go.

## Why?

Most new terminals offer their features only behind a paywall, and nobody likes that. That's why we decided to write a new, faster terminal app in the Rust programming language, where we provide all features for free.

## Sponsoring

**Currently, there is no direct way of sponsoring.**

If you want to help out the project, please open a pull request, and we will try to merge it if it fits our coding style. See "Contributing" for more details.

## Contributing

Please follow this coding style guideline:

- Use tabs instead of spaces for indenting.
- Comment on top of your function, explaining what it is doing, how it is doing it, and what the inputs and outputs are.
- Use the "DRY" concept; DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!
- The comments should be in easy-to-understand English.
- Also, put your GitHub username inside the comment on top of your function. This provides an easy way of crediting you on our website. If you don't want credit, leave it blank.

Example code block:
```rust
/*
This function does "X" by...
  1. Doing XYZ
  2. Comparing foo to bar
  3. Calculating the sum of atoms in the universe

### BLOCK START
# function: my_function
# GitHub: contributor 1
# GitHub: contributor 2
# ...
### BLOCK END
*/

fn my_function() {
  println!("Hello, world!");

  another_function();
}

```
