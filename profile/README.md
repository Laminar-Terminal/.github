# EST 2024

We are Laminar-terminal.

Our aim is to provide a new Terminal with custom Addon support, Themes and a way to keep all your dotfiles synced and safe inside a github repo!

Why?

Well you see most new terminals offer their features only behind a paywall, nobody likes that.
Thats why we decided to write a new fester Terminal app in the Rust Programming language where we provide all features for free.

# Sponsoring?

Currently there is no direct way of sponsoring. 

If you want to help out the project please open a pull request and we will try to merge it, if it fits our coding style.

See "Contributing" for more.

# Contributing

Please follow this Coding Style Guideline:

- Use tabs instead of spaces for indenting
- Comment on top of your function what it is doing, how it is doing it and what the inputs and outputs are.
- The comments should be in an easy to understand englisch language.
- Also put your github username inside the comment on top of your function, this provides an easy way of crediting you on our website. If you don't want credit lead it blank

Example code block:
```rust
/*
This function does "X" by...
  1. Doing XYZ
  2. Comparing foo to bar
  3. Calculating the sum of atoms in the universe

### BLOCK START
# function: my_function
# GitHub: contributer 1
# Github: contributer 2
# ...
### BLOCK END
*/

fn my_function() {
  println!("Hello, world!");

  my_another_function();
}

```
